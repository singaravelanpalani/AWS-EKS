## Step-01: Create EKS Cluster using eksctl With VPC-2 Tier  
```
# Create Cluster
eksctl create cluster --name=etechbrain-prod \
                      --region=ap-south-1 \
                      --zones=ap-south-1a,ap-south-1b,ap-south-1c\
                      --without-nodegroup \
                      --tags Environment=Production,Project=ETB,CreatedBy=Velan,ApprovedBy=DRL-Viswa,ReviewedBy=DRL-Arun
# Get List of clusters
eksctl get clusters                  
```


## Step-02: Create & Associate IAM OIDC Provider for our EKS Cluster
- To enable and use AWS IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts on our EKS cluster, we must create &  associate OIDC identity provider.
```
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
    --region ap-south-1 \
    --cluster etechbrain-prod \
    --approve
```
## Step-03: Create EC2 Keypair
- Create a new EC2 Keypair with name as `etechbrain-prod-eks`
```
aws --region ap-south-1 ec2 create-key-pair \
    --key-name "etchbrain-prod-eks" | jq -r ".KeyMaterial" > etchbrain-prod-eks.pem
```

## Step-04: Create Node Group with additional Add-Ons in Private Subnets 
- These add-ons will create the respective IAM policies for us automatically within our Node Group role.
 ```
# Create Private Node Group   
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=etechbrain-prod \
                        --region=ap-south-1 \
                        --name=etechbrain-prod-ng-private1 \
                        --node-type=t3.medium \
                        --nodes-min=2 \
                        --nodes-max=4 \
                        --node-volume-size=20 \
                        --ssh-access \
                        --ssh-public-key=etechbrain-prod-eks \
                        --managed \
                        --asg-access \
                        --external-dns-access \
                        --full-ecr-access \
                        --appmesh-access \
                        --alb-ingress-access \
                        --node-private-networking 
```

## Step-05: Verify Cluster & Nodes

### Verify NodeGroup subnets to confirm EC2 Instances are in Public Subnet
- Verify the node group subnet to ensure it created in public subnets
  - Go to Services -> EKS -> etechbrain-prod -> etechbrain-prod-ng1-public
  - Click on Associated subnet in **Details** tab
  - Click on **Route Table** Tab.
  - We should see that internet route via Internet Gateway (0.0.0.0/0 -> igw-xxxxxxxx)

### Verify Cluster, NodeGroup in EKS Management Console
- Go to Services -> Elastic Kubernetes Service -> etechbrain-prod

### List Worker Nodes
```
# List EKS clusters
eksctl get cluster

# List NodeGroups in a cluster
eksctl get nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName>

# List Nodes in current kubernetes cluster
kubectl get nodes -o wide



# Our kubectl context should be automatically changed to new cluster
kubectl config view --minify
```
### Verify Worker Node IAM Role and list of Policies
- Go to Services -> EC2 -> Worker Nodes
- Click on **IAM Role associated to EC2 Worker Nodes**

### Verify Security Group Associated to Worker Nodes
- Go to Services -> EC2 -> Worker Nodes
- Click on **Security Group** associated to EC2 Instance which contains `remote` in the name.

### Verify CloudFormation Stacks
- Verify Control Plane Stack & Events
- Verify NodeGroup Stack & Events

### Login to Worker Node using Keypai kube-demo
- Login to worker node
```
# For MAC or Linux or Windows10
ssh -i etechbrain-prod-eks.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP-of-Worker-Node>

# For Windows 7
Use putty
```

## Step-06: Update Worker Nodes Security Group to allow all traffic
- We need to allow `All Traffic` on worker node security group

# Delete EKS Cluster & Node Groups

## Step-01: Delete Node Group
- We can delete a nodegroup separately using below `eksctl delete nodegroup`
```
# List EKS Clusters
eksctl get clusters

# Capture Node Group name
eksctl get nodegroup --cluster=etechbrain-prod

# Delete Node Group
eksctl delete nodegroup --cluster=etechbrain-prod --name=etechbrain-prod-ng-public1
```
## Step-02: Delete Cluster  
- We can delete cluster using `eksctl delete cluster`
```
# Delete Cluster
eksctl delete cluster <clusterName>
eksctl delete cluster etechbrain-prod
```
## Important Notes

### Note-1: Rollback any Security Group Changes
- When we create a EKS cluster using `eksctl` it creates the worker node security group with only port 22 access.
- When we progress through the course, we will be creating many **NodePort Services** to access and test our applications via browser. 
- During this process, we need to add an additional rule to this automatically created security group, allowing access to our applications we have deployed. 
- So the point we need to understand here is when we are deleting the cluster using `eksctl`, its core components should be in same state which means roll back the change we have done to security group before deleting the cluster.
- In this way, cluster will get deleted without any issues, else we might have issues and we need to refer cloudformation events and manually delete few things. In short, we need to go to many places for deletions. 

### Note-2: Rollback any EC2 Worker Node Instance Role - Policy changes
- When we are doing `EBS Storage Section with EBS CSI Driver` we will add a custom policy to worker node IAM role.
- When you are deleting the cluster, first roll back that change and delete it. 
- This way we don't face any issues during cluster deletion.
